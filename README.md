LC50 provides facilities for estimating lethal concentrations for a
toxin from destructively sampled survival data in the presence of
additional stressors and non-ignorable control mortality.


## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package.

```R
devtools::install_github("ahproctor/LC50")
```

If you don't have `devtools` installed already, install it first.

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

(LC50 otherwise does not need devtools for normal use.)
